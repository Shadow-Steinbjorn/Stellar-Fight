# Stellar Fight

**Stellar Fight** is a stellar-based arcade-style fighting game where players engage in one-on-one duels. As players win, they earn **StellarToken**, a custom Stellar-based asset. This project leverages the strengths of the Stellar blockchain by enabling players to earn, spend, and donate tokens within the game ecosystem.
