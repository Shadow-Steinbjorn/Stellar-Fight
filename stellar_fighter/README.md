# Stellar Fight

Stellar Fight is an arcade-style, one-on-one fighting game with a blockchain twist. Players battle against each other in intense duels, and winners are rewarded with **StellarToken**, a custom asset built on the Stellar blockchain. As players win consecutive battles, they can earn streak bonuses, unlocking more tokens and donate to charities. This is a project idea from the EASYA x Stellar Meridian Hackathon, 12th to 13th October, 2024.
